        One day, Octavio Silva was bored. In fact, he was bored most days.<br>
        Son of the preoccupied CEO of Silva Pharmaceuticals and<br>
        wanting for nothing in life, he entertained himself by performing<br>
        death-defying stunts and posting holovids of them for his fans to<br>
        gawk over. He decided to set the course record for a nearby<br> 
        Gauntlet by launching himself across the finish line – using a<br> 
        grenade.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        As he lay in triage hours later, the doctors informed him that the<br>
        damage done to his legs meant his daredevil days were over. That<br>
        didn’t sit well with Octavio, who turned to an old friend for help:<br>
        <a class="link-danger" href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/about/characters/lifeline">Ajay Che</a>, who he guilted into forging an order to replace his legs<br>
        with bionic ones. Suddenly able to repair his limbs at a moment’s<br>
        notice, Octavio decided petty online stunts weren’t enough: the<br>
        ultimate adrenaline rush, the Apex Games, was calling. Since then,<br>
        despite learning the man he thought was his father is his<br>
        grandfather and new head of the Syndicate and the Games, he’s<br>
        worked to become an Apex Champion by doing the most<br>
        incredible, death-defying moves anyone’s ever seen. Maybe in the<br>
        arena, he won’t be so bored.
